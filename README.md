# Basic Project Plan
## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

## Tasks

To complete this project, I used a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieved geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days and added them to an interactive map using Mapbox and the Leaflet library.

## Approach

I used JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. I used the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and created interactivity for the earthquake data across three map layers.

Deploying a secure server, open the [HTML](Earthquake_Challenge/index.html) from the [Earthquake_Challenge Folder](https://github.com/scottemac00/GeoJSON_Maps/tree/main/Earthquake_Challenge) and enjoy the last seven days of world earthquake information!
